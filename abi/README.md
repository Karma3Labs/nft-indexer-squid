# ABI folder

## Generated types were broken

This is a dedicated folder for ABI files. Place you contract ABI here and generate facade classes for type-safe decoding of the event, function data and contract state queries with

```sh
sqd typegen
```

This `typegen` command is defined in `commands.json`.
